===================
L10n Nz Tax Periods
===================

Use dates as per tax year for tax closing entry

Configuration
=============

Provided this module is in your addons path, it will autoinstall if l10n_nz is installed. However it
may be manually installed for over localizations.

If your VAT/GST reporting period does not align with the fiscal year, you can set the Parameter `vat_period_end` in
the format `MM-DD`.

Usage
=====

To use this module there is nothing to do by default. It will automatically determine the GST Reporting Period
for closing entry from the fiscalyear settings on the company. If the GST/VAT reporting does not align with the fiscal
year you can set the Parameter `vat_period_end` in the format `MM-DD`.
